# Bot_Emmett_Brown
This is a bot trained to talk like Doc Emmett Brown from Back to the Future series. The NLP is done by a LTSM neural network using Keras and TensorFlow as kernel. To train I recommend having a CUDA enabled installation otherwise it will take forever.
The dockerized versions are available through the Dockerfiles... so, just run the ```exec.sh``` file.

I have a Twitter bot up and running using this
